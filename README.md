Javascript video poker game

Basic video poker functionality is in place. There is no betting.

The design is static. Responsive design will be added later.

HTML5 browser compatibility is assumed. There is no handling of unsupported features in older browsers. In other words, no graceful degradation.

No Javascript frameworks were used. The premise was to create functionality in pure Javascript for the sake of minimal file size.
